
Massive E-commerce Application

This is a full-stack e-commerce application that I developed to showcase my skills in modern web development. The project leverages powerful tools and technologies like React, Redux, GraphQL, Stripe, and Firebase to provide a seamless and secure shopping experience. Itâ€™s built with scalability and performance in mind, making it suitable for a real-world production environment.


Key Features

1 User Authentication:
Built with Firebase Authentication to allow users to securely sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
Integration with email/password authentication, Google login, and more.

2.State Management with Redux:
Implemented Redux to manage the app's global state for cart management, user session, and other app-level data.
Used Redux Toolkit for simplified store configuration and management.

3.GraphQL Integration:
Used GraphQL to query data from a remote server, including fetching products, handling orders, and managing user data in a highly efficient and flexible way.

4.Real-Time Data with Firebase:
Utilized Firebase Firestore for real-time database capabilities, such as displaying live inventory updates, order status changes, and user-related data.

5.Payment Integration with Stripe:
Integrated Stripe for secure payment processing, allowing users to make purchases directly on the site with various payment methods.
Configured Stripe Elements for custom and seamless payment forms.

6.Responsive Design:
Created a fully responsive, mobile-first design using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and styled-components.
Ensured the application looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
